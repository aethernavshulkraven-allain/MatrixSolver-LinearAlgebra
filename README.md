# MatrixSolver-LinearAlgebra
Write a program in Python to solve the homogenous system Ax=0 and write the general solution in parametric vector form.

program should accept as input the size of the matrix, i.e. the number of rows and the number of columns of A, and also the entries of A.

The input should ideally be read from a text file,
Your code should be based on algorithms learned in the course. No pre-existing routines from Python libraries should be used.
